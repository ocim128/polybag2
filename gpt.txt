analyze idea.txt do you see a super clever opportunity trade to build?


=========================================
Yes. The best “clever” edge in your idea.txt is a cross-market subset arbitrage between 15m and the 3rd 5m market.

Your note says 15m and 3rd 5m share the same terminal resolution price (idea.txt (line 14)), while order books are independent (idea.txt (line 31), idea.txt (line 33)).
That means they are two binaries with same expiry price S_T but different strikes:
A: 15m YES = S_T > K15
B: 5m(3rd) YES = S_T > K5
If K5 > K15, then B ⊆ A (YES on 5m implies YES on 15m).
So buy YES(A) + NO(B). This pays at least 1 in all outcomes.
Arb trigger: ask_yes_A + ask_no_B < 1 - fees - slippage_buffer.

If K5 < K15, reverse it: buy YES(B) + NO(A) with same logic.

This is stronger than “fair value” trading: it’s a structural pricing inequality, not a prediction.

=========================================

show me the probability math
=========================================
Use this setup.

Let:

L
L: lower-strike event (e.g. 15m YES), 
L
=
{
S
T
>
K
L
}
L={S 
T
​
 >K 
L
​
 }
H
H: higher-strike event (e.g. 3rd 5m YES), 
H
=
{
S
T
>
K
H
}
H={S 
T
​
 >K 
H
​
 }
with 
K
H
>
K
L
K 
H
​
 >K 
L
​
 , so 
H
⊆
L
H⊆L
Then buy bundle:

Π
=
YES
(
L
)
+
NO
(
H
)
Π=YES(L)+NO(H)
Its payoff at expiry:

Π
=
1
L
+
(
1
−
1
H
)
=
1
+
1
L
∖
H
Π=1 
L
​
 +(1−1 
H
​
 )=1+1 
L∖H
​
 
So payoff is always 
≥
1
≥1, and equals 2 when 
K
L
<
S
T
≤
K
H
K 
L
​
 <S

 .

Fair value of bundle:

(

P
(

)
FV(Π)=P(L)+(1−P(H))=1+(P(L)−P(H))
Execution math (using asks):

C
=

YES
(
L
)
+
a
NO
(
H
)
C=a 
YES(L)
​
 +a 
NO(H)

Guaranteed-profit condition (after fees/slippage buffer 
b

C

b
<

C+b<1
Expected-value condition:

E
V

P
(

 −C−b
So even when 
C
≥
1
C≥1, it can still be +EV if the middle-band probability is big enough.
If 
C
<
1
C<1, it is a hard arbitrage floor trade.
