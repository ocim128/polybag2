Both 5-min and 15-min Markets use Chainlink Data for resolution settlement

2 out of 3 charts at 5-min markets open/close at the same price as 15-min one

Is there any cross-market arbitrage?

read more in thread:

First market closes, Second continues, Third opens

67% of 5-min markets are attached to 15-min markets:

> price to beat matches with 1st 5-min market
> resolution price matches with 3rd 5-min market
> 2nd 50min market is not directly attached to 15-min market conditions.

///

Charts of both 5-min and 15-min markets are identical, no any difference

Price data is supplied by Chainlink.

Chainlink public terminal price has ~80 seconds delay from actual price. crucial with no doubts.

Polymarket shows almost real actual prices (250-500ms)

Only this is often enough to claim +EV from unexpected squeezes even with no use of bots.

///

5-min and 15-min markets are independent.

There's a separate orderbook for each of them.

Odds for YES/NO outcomes in majority are settled by different traders.

In minority by existing arbitrage bots.

They're similar to those who trade EITHER 15-min or 5-min markets

BUT the strategy is originally different and much more complicated:

Instead of Chainlink delay avoidance and 'fair' odds analysis, they trade delta-neutral cross-markets arbitrage.

There're complicated triggers causing txn execution

But what are they? I am asking devs right now.
